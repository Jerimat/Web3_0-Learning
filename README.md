# Web3_0-Learning
Different quests performed in my learning path to Web 3.0.

_(Questbook.app)_
- **Ethereum Path** _(coded and tested on Remix Web IDE)_: 

  - Creating a Bank smart contract able to manage ETH and any ERC20 token. The bank manages accounts in cETH _(Compound ETH)_ -> Any time the smart contract receives currency, it mints it to Compound to generate interests. 
  When users want to withdraw, either ETH or any ERC20 token, the smart account redeems the cETH tokens for the speicified tokens.

  - Creating a crpytocurrency
  
  - Launching an NFT
  
  
  
- **MyBlockchain** _(coded and tested on PyCharm)_:
  
  - Basics of Blockchain programming
